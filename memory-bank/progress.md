# Progress

**What Works:**
- A clear, step-by-step plan has been established for setting up the VPS, deploying the code, installing dependencies, running the data pipeline, and transferring processed data back to the local machine.
- The plan incorporates best practices for code management (`git`) and efficient data transfer (`rsync`).
- The project's dependencies and operational procedures have been identified from `README.md` and `pyproject.toml`.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Actual execution of the setup and pipeline on the VPS.
- Verification of data collection and processing.
- Regular data synchronization from VPS to local.

**Current Status:**
- Planning phase complete.
- Memory bank initialized with project context and plan.
- Ready to proceed with the execution of the VPS setup steps.

**Known Issues:**
- None identified at this stage.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Initial decision to use `rsync` for code transfer was revised to `git` for better version control and deployment practices.
