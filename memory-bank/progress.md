# Progress

**What Works:**
- The entire data pipeline (`update_markets`, `update_goldsky`, `process_live`) is now fully implemented using a robust, memory-efficient, partitioned Parquet strategy.
- The pipeline is resilient to common API inconsistencies, including missing columns and shifting data types.
- The `update_markets.py` script efficiently fetches only the newest markets by querying in descending order.
- The `process_live.py` script processes data in small, file-based chunks to operate safely on low-memory systems.
- A one-time migration script (`migrate_orderfilled.py`) was successfully developed to convert legacy single-file data into the new partitioned format.

**What's Left to Build:**
- The core data engineering pipeline is complete. The project can now move into the data analysis and utilization phase.

**Current Status:**
- The full data pipeline has been refactored and debugged. The user is ready to run the final `process_live.py` script to generate the first batch of clean, processed trade data.

**Known Issues:**
- All major known issues related to memory usage, API inconsistencies, and faulty resume logic have been resolved.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- The project began as a simple request to convert CSV files to Parquet but evolved significantly upon encountering real-world data challenges.
- **Memory Errors:** Initial out-of-memory crashes on the VPS forced a move from in-memory processing to batch/chunk-based processing for all scripts.
- **API Instability:** Inconsistent schemas from the Polymarket and Goldsky APIs (missing columns, wrong data types) required a shift to defensive coding. Scripts now dynamically check for columns and cast data types to prevent errors.
- **Inefficient Logic:** The initial market update logic was found to be extremely inefficient (paging through all historical data). This was re-architected to fetch newest data first and stop when an overlap was found, dramatically improving performance.
